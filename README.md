# Marco Cook

Deployed app: https://marcocookwebsite.herokuapp.com/

## Code validation testing

To initially test the website I used the following validators:

[W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) Service for HTML I inserted the code into the validator via direct input. I consistently checked used this throughut previous checks, where any errors/warnings were addressed directly and documented in commits. Upon a final check no erros/warnings were present.

[W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Service for CSS I inserted the code into the validator via direct input. No errors were were found upon final check.
